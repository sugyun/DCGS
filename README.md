# Divide and conquer algorithm for global stabilization (DCGS)
Find control sets for global stabilization of a target attractor by finding optimal FVS subsets (canalizing sets) using canalizing effect without considering monostability in each SCC and then combining them.

Please check "example.ipynb".
