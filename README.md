# Divide and conquer algorithm for global stabilization (DCGS)
Find control sets for global stabilization of a target attractor by finding optimal FVS subsets (canalizing sets) using canalizing effect without considering monostability in each SCC and then combining them.

Please check "Tutorial_example.ipynb".

# Requirements
- python v3.x
- networkx v2.5
- sympy v1.4
- numpy v2.0
