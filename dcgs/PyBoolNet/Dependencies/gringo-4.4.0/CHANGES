gringo/clingo 4.4.0
  * updated underlying clasp to version 3.1.0
    * this version brings numerous fixes regarding incremetal solving

    * ground takes a list of programs to ground now and immediately starts
      grounding (breaks backwards compatibility)
    * asolve has been renamed to solveAsync
      (breaks backwards compatibility)
    * the solver configuration is better integrated now
      (breaks backwards compatibility)
    * solver statistics are a property now
      (breaks backwards compatibility)
    * added a method to add clauses during solving
    * added load method to load files
    * added solveIter method to iterate over methods without using a callback
    * added optional assumptions to solve/solveAsync/solveIter method
