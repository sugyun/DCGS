Gringo is a grounder that, given an input program with first-order variables,
computes an equivalent ground (variable-free) program. Its output can be
processed further with answer set solvers like clasp, cmodels, or smodels.

Clingo combines both gringo and clasp into a monolithic system. This way it
offers more control over the grounding and solving process than gringo and
clasp can offer individually - e.g., incremental grounding and solving.

The Python gringo module offers the functionality of clingo in form of a Python
module.
